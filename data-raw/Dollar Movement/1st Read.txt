Geographical Movement of One Dollar Notes between the 12 Federal Reserve Board districts, observed 
in a sample taken in February 1976 (after Pignatello 1977). File 'Dollar.tbl' contains the values, 
in hundreds. Rows are the FROM places, columns are the TO places.

X. Y coordinates are in kilometers on a local map projection of the United States (Tobler 1974) 
and are centroids within each Federal Reserve Board district. This is file 'DlrXY.pts'

The 'UsaBdy.ply' file uses these same coordinates for a simplified US outline.
Names of the FRB districts are in the File 'FRB Names.txt'

For more information on the source of the federal reserve note movement see the power point 
presentation under movement at http://www.geog.ucsb.edu/~tobler 
and the reprints on geographic movement on the same web site. 

Several maps illustrate some of the variety available with the flow mapping program.

A separate folder, FRB_BNDs, contains the polygons including the FRB districts (except Alaska & 
Hawaii), but in a different coordinate system, in FRBbnds.Ply. FRBcenters.pts contains the 
centroids for these regions in the same coordinate system.
