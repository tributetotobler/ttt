              1935-1940

 State to State migration tables, with Alaska, Washington DC, and Hawaii
 (arbitrarily) deleted. Some of the files have the diagonal entries set 
 to zero. You can check the tables against Census Document
 PC80-S1-9 "State of Residence in 1975 by State of Residence in 1980", 1980
 Census of Population Supplementary Report, March 1983. The remaining
 tables came from comparable earlier reports. For reasons which I cannot
 recall, the 49-50 table is in 10's of people, the 55-60 and 65-70 tables
 are in 100's of persons. All of the tables have been converted to
 alphabetical order from the regional order used by the Census Bureau. The
 rows of the tables are the FROM places; the columns are the TO places.
 The 1984-1985 & 1994-1995 tables are from the IRS estimates.
 Also included is a boundary file, centroid and names files for the CSISS 
 flow mapper program (CSISS.org/Spatial Tools/Flow Mapper).

 I hope that you find these useful. Please bring any errors which you
 detect to my attention.
